        <h2>Projects:</h2>

        <div class="subject">
            <h3>Black Friday</h3>
            <p>The first game I ever made with my friends was Black Friday. You play as a humanoid string cheese stick named Mac, 
             and you're tasked with buying milk from a supermarket on black friday. Flying pizzas and sentient pasta noodles serve as the enemies,
             while the employees help you along your journey.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subject">
            <h3>IronWood</h3>
            <p>This was the next big project to come after Black Friday. You play as a tree with guns trying to stop a doomsday cult from summoning 
            and ancient evil by slaying every foe in your wake. This one takes lots of inspiration from old school shooters like Doom, Quake, and Unreal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subject">
            <h3>Ice Age Game</h3>
            <p>Most games I come up with never get out of the planning stage, on account of me not knowing how to code games. This one 
             would've had you play as a mystical creature made of snow and ice that can dawn different fossilized skulls that would give different abilities.
             Also an old school shooter like IronWood.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subject">
            <h3>Hatchet Man Game</h3>
            <p>This one also never made it out of the planning phase. It would've been a third person platforming game with a heavy focus on combat. 
            You'd play as a guy who can throw hatchets extremely fast, with the ability to collect different hatchets with unique abilities as you progress through the game</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subject">
            <h3>Jake and the 8 Pages</h3>
            <p>This one is more of a joke game, but nonetheless, is in progress right now. It's a game in roblox where you play as me filming a 
            Ghost Hunters video in a dark scary forest. Instead of a slender man creature, I get chased around by a giant evil tree. As more levels and areas are made,
            more monsters will be added into the game.</p>
